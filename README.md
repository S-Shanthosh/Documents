1) For the past one year working with Trianz, and I got the Aniversary email as well. 
The automations that I have successfully implemented made a significant cost savings for client. Earning appreciation from the clients.

2)Please find me an opportunity to be placed in an any available project. If no immediate project is available, I am open to contributing to the Monitoring Team or Support Team.
